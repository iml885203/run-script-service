# Plan 001: Streaming Executor Timeout Enhancement

## Objective
Enhance the streaming executor to support configurable timeouts for long-running scripts, preventing resource exhaustion and improving system reliability.

## Current State
- ✅ ExecuteWithStreaming method implemented
- ✅ ExecuteWithResultStreaming method implemented
- ✅ Streaming log handling working
- ✅ Real-time output processing functional
- ❌ No timeout support for streaming executions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Add Timeout Support to StreamingExecutor Interface
- [x] Add timeout configuration to Executor struct
- [x] Modify ExecuteWithStreaming to respect timeout
- [x] Add timeout tests for streaming execution

### Phase 2: Implement Graceful Timeout Handling
- [ ] Add timeout error handling with proper cleanup
- [ ] Ensure streaming log handlers are notified of timeout
- [ ] Add timeout-specific log entries

### Phase 3: Integration with Configuration
- [ ] Add timeout configuration to script config
- [ ] Update CLI commands to support timeout setting
- [ ] Add timeout validation

## Success Criteria
- Streaming execution respects configurable timeouts
- Proper error handling and cleanup on timeout
- Log handlers receive timeout notifications
- All existing tests continue to pass
- New timeout tests demonstrate functionality

## Notes
This enhancement addresses a potential resource leak where long-running scripts could consume system resources indefinitely when using streaming execution.
